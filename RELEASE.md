# Release Process

This document describes how to create and publish releases for Voice Recorder.

## Version Numbering

We use semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH):
- **MAJOR**: Breaking changes
- **MINOR**: New features
- **PATCH**: Bug fixes

Current version: 1.0.1

## Creating a Release

### 1. Update Version

Update version in `package.json`:
```json
{
  "version": "1.0.1"
}
```

### 2. Build Executables

```bash
# Clean build
rm -rf dist node_modules
npm install
npm run build-all
```

This creates:
- `dist/VoiceRecorder-Setup.exe` - Windows installer
- `dist/VoiceRecorder-Portable.exe` - Portable version

### 3. Test Builds

Before releasing:
- [ ] Test installer on clean Windows system
- [ ] Test portable version
- [ ] Verify icon displays correctly
- [ ] Test recording and transcription
- [ ] Check all keyboard shortcuts
- [ ] Verify auto-update works (if implemented)

1. Go to [Releases](https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/voice-recorder/releases)
2. Click "Draft a new release"
3. Create a new tag (e.g., `v1.0.1`)
4. Set release title: `Voice Recorder v1.0.1`
