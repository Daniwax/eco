## Known Issues

1. **Portable Version Icon**: The portable version may display the default Electron icon instead of the custom icon. This is a known limitation with portable Electron apps on Windows.

2. **Multiple Instances**: Only one instance can run at a time. If the app seems unresponsive, check Task Manager for existing instances.

3. **Microphone Access**: On first run, Windows may prompt for microphone permission. Make sure to allow access.

## Troubleshooting

### App Won't Start
- Check if another instance is running in Task Manager
- Try running as Administrator
- Check Windows Defender or antivirus isn't blocking it

### No Transcription
- Verify your Groq API key is correct
- Check internet connection
- Ensure microphone is working and not muted
- Check logs folder (Ctrl+L) for error details

### Widget Disappeared
- Press F9 to toggle visibility
- Check bottom-right corner of screen
- Look for the app icon in system tray

### Stuck in Blue State
- Press Escape to force reset
- Long-press the widget for 2 seconds
- Restart the application if needed
